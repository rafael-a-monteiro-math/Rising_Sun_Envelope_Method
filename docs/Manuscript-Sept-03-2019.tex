\begin{abstract}
The lack of theoretical understanding of X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure  (XANES) spectroscopy makes the development of analysis tools for its study a necessity. 
Here, an algorithm for judicious choice of local minima and maxima points of XANES spectrum (experimental or simulated) is proposed, without any loss of information on  peaks location nor on peak strength. We call it the  \textit{Rising Sun Envelope Method},  since it is based on successive regularizations of the spectral measurement that, according to parameter choices that are intrinsic to the measurements, keep peaks location and strength as invariants. This is the first method that finds peaks in XANES automatically, without depending on first derivative information. Nevertheless, a direct computation of Absorption-Edge is provided, where we avoid the issue inflection point computations based on the XANES second derivative, dealing instead with simpler computations of inflection points of higher quality cubic spline approximation. Besides applications of the algorithm to XANES, we illustrate  further applications in  Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) and Raman spectra.

\section*{Introduction}
%
Atomic-Absorption Spectroscopy is a fundamental tool in Material Sciences for characterization of physical and chemical properties of materials \cite{koningsberger1988x}. 
In its foundations, the method is based on the photoelectric effect: upon interaction with  photons or other particles the material's atoms  absorb, emit, and reflect  incoming radiation to neighboring atoms, thus providing information about the material's atomic structure and its complexities \cite[\S 1-2]{bunkeR1010introduction}. 
In spite of its wide use, it is still a challenging task to extract meaningful and relevant information from spectra obtained in experimental measurements, and many theoretical questions in the field remain open.


One type of these measurements is known as X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure  (XANES) \cite{frenkel2012synchrotron,kuzmin2014exafs,newville2014fundamentals} observed in X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS),
where local structure and valence (or oxidation) state can be inferred from the way peaks amplify and shift horizontally when compared to peaks of a reference, non-oxidized, sample \cite{Zhao_structure,Belli,Peak_shift,lin2019highly,mao2017design}. Several approaches to valence determination and material oxidation exist: for instance,  Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to obtain \textit{valence state fingerprinting}, i.e., characterization of valence state by interpolating it with a mixture of pure-valence species \cite{PCA-valence}, a technique that is mathematically robust and powerful but rely on first derivative computations \cite{manceau2014estimating}, which lacks on mathematical rigor, for the spectra contains (non-differentiable) noise \cite{DEK}. Direct use of first derivatives is also common  \cite{First_derivative,ravel2005athena}. From a somewhat different perspective, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been shown to be an effective method to unveil 3D structures in Nanoparticles \cite{ML-Timo-2019}, and characterize oxidation state by use of statistical methods \cite{zheng2018automated}; in the context of XANES, it has been applied with the aim of predicting oxidation state by learning the peak shift  \cite{miyazato2019automatic}. Nevertheless, all these techniques rely on peak location, derivative computations, or peak shift estimates, but up to now no method can locate a sequence of peaks in an accurate fashion. It is worth to point out that regularization through smoothing is successfully used in linear filtering and denoising of images, because it averages noise and keep low frequencies \cite{Mallat}; however, it smears peak location and their strength, which are the objects we are mostly interested at \cite[\S 6]{HaTiFr}.
      \newline
 \indent
 In this paper we take a step to address, and mitigate,  the aforementioned issues of characterization of peak location in XANES by means that are not rigorous (as differentiation methods) proposing a new method that does not smear out neither peak location nor peak strength. As it is the case with several tools of signal processing, the Rising Sun Envelope Method relies on resolution parameters that set up thresholds for peak location based on both their height and   how far apart they are.   One of the building blocks of the paper is called  the \textit{Rising Sun Envelope Method}\footnote{The idea is based on a construction by Riesz, in what became known as the \textit{Rising Sun Lemma} \cite[Lemma 3.5]{Stein}, developed with the intent of understanding the pointwise behavior of continuous functions. In our case, we are interested in reducing the oscillation of the function in the sense of \ref{def:osc}, which is exactly what the Rising Sun operator \ref{rising_sun} does.}, in which an operator regularizes the XANES spectrum. The latter operator is applied successively in different energy range intervals, a  process  along which an invariant is kept at each step: in the corresponding interval, both the measurement and its regularization have their first peak located at the same point. In each step these intervals get smaller, yielding a  chained sequence of intervals and an increasing  sequence of peak locations in the energy range.
 
Towards the end of the paper several applications are given: approximated splines are constructed, and an automatic and a more accurate way to locate  inflection points is proposed. We remark that the latter do not rely on finite difference methods applied to the XANES measurement in order to find the second order derivatives, a computation that gives  highly oscillatory results due to noise but, in spite of its poor quality,  has been commonly used in the literature. Furthermore, the method provides a dimension reduction of the XANES measurement by judicious choice of interpolation points that can be then used for interpolation by polygonal, cubic splines , or clamped cubic splines glued up to first derivative. In the latter case, we assert the quality of our approximation by  comparing the inflection points obtained with the second order derivative  obtained by Athena, a well established software for XANES computations \cite{Athena}.  Finally, due to its generality, the Rising Sun envelope method can also be applied to other types of spectra,  a fact that we  illustrate with an application to Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) and Raman spectra. 
 

 \section*{The Rising Sun and Valley of Shadows associated functions: an algorithm for peak location}\label{sec:rising_sun} Noise plagues spectral measurements with local maxima and minima, making the very distinction between  peaks and %a spike coming from noise 
pure noise fluctuations in many ways relying on the experimentalist's subjective judgement. The  definitions in this section introduce two parameters that aim to both quantify and clarify the peak characterization. 

In what follows, we shall consider a spectral measurement $\mu(E)$, where $e_{-\infty}\leq E\leq e_{+\infty}$ denotes the energy range of measurement on a meshgrid $\delta n$, where $n$ is an integer and $\delta>0$ the meshgrid width. The continuous function $\mu(E)$
represents the material's absorption at energy level $E$. %, that is,  its response to any type of bombardment (by ion or X-Ray, for example).  %
We shall denote the restriction of this mapping to a smaller energy rage $a\leq E \leq b$ by $\mu\Big|_{[a,b]}(E)$. Without any loss of generality, we can normalize the spectrum and consider $\displaystyle{\max_{e_{-\infty}\leq E\leq e_{+\infty}}\mu(E) - \min_{e_{-\infty}\leq E\leq e_{+\infty}}\mu(E)=1}$ and $\mu(e_{-\infty})=0$.

\begin{Definition}[Peak criterion with thresholds $(h_*,d_*)$] \label{def:rising_sun} Given the a measurement $\mu(E)$ in energy range $e_{-\infty}\leq E\leq e_{+\infty}$ and fixed constants $h_*>0$ and $d_*>0$. Let $e_{-\infty}\leq e_*<\overline{E} \leq e_{+\infty}$. We say that $\overline{E}$ is a local maximum relative to $e_*$ with thresholds $(h_*,d_*)$ whenever
%
\begin{align}\label{def:loc_max1}
 \left\vert\mu\left(\overline{E}\right) - \mu(e_*)\right\vert >h_*, \quad\mbox{and} \quad \mu\left(\overline{E}\right) \geq \mu(E)
\end{align} 
%
holds for all  $e_{-\infty} \leq E\leq e_{+\infty}$ with $\vert E - \overline{E}\vert \leq d_*$ (see Figure \ref{fig:threshold_slecting_peaks}). Similarly, one says that point $e_*< \underline{E}\leq e_{+\infty}$ is a local minimum relative to $e_*$ with thresholds $(h_*,d_*)$ whenever
%
\begin{align}\label{def:loc_max1}
 \left\vert\mu(e_*) - \mu\left(\underline{E}\right) \right\vert>h_*, \quad \mbox{and} \quad \mu\left(\underline{E}\right) \leq \mu(E)
\end{align} 

%
holds for all  $e_{-\infty} \leq E\leq e_{+\infty}$ with $\vert E - \underline{E}\vert \leq d_*$.
\end{Definition}
%
\begin{figure}[htb]
 \includegraphics[width=85mm]{figures/rising_sun_with_thresholds_example}
 \caption{An illustration of the use of $(h_*, d_*)$ in peak finding:  $\mu(E)$ is represented as full line (blue). When looking for a local maximum with threshold $(h_*,d_*)$ relative to $(e_*,\mu(e_*))$, the first value in $\widetilde{e}$ is not considered a local maximum when $\alpha \leq h_*$; on the other hand, if $\alpha >h_*$, $\widetilde{e}$ is considered a local maximum only if $d_* <\beta$. The same analysis holds for $\overline{E}$, its relative height $\mu\left(\overline{E}\right) - \mu(e_*)$ and plateau size $\gamma$. The curve in  red represents the  Rising Sun function $\mathcal{R}_{\mu}(E)$ introduced in \eqref{rising_sun}, a valuable tool to verify the conditions in definition \ref{def:rising_sun}.\label{fig:threshold_slecting_peaks}}
\end{figure}
%
The thresholds  $h_*>0$, $d_*>0$ are quantities used to discern local maxima/minima as \textit{pure noise} or \text{true peaks}. For instance,  taking the limit $h_* \to +\infty$ (resp., taking the limit $d_*\to  +\infty$), no local maxima/minima are found whereas, due to noise, in the limit $h_* \to 0$ (resp., $d_*\to \delta$) too many points are characterized as so. Thus, both thresholds must be tuned in order to capture intrinsic properties of the spectrum, like noise and relative distance between peaks; in that sense, both parameters play the role of \textit{resolutions}, as in some tools of signal processing \footnote{This is similar to the role of dilation and translation parameters in Wavelet theory with regards to resolution. The analogy is limited to the role of parameters, and do not extend beyond that because we are not doing time-frequency analysis \cite{Mallat,Lectures}. }. Furthermore, peak jumps display decaying properties, therefore it is important to take into account the relative dependence between successive maxima/minima, which is done by making each point a local maxima or minima with respect to the previous breakpoint. This remark leads to the following:

\begin{Definition}[M-breakpoints with $(h_*^{(n)},d_*^{(n)})$ threshold] \label{def:min_max_2}
Consider a  measurement $\mu(E)$ in the energy range $e_{-\infty}\leq E\leq e_{+\infty}$. Let $M >0$ be a fixed integer,  and $h_*^{(n)}>0$, $d_*^{(n)}>0$, where $0\leq n \leq M$. Consider the points 
 %
 \begin{align}\label{chain}
  e_{-\infty} < e_0 <e_1 <... e_M \leq e_{+\infty}.
 \end{align}
%
We say that this is a  sequence \eqref{chain} of M-breakpoints with $(h_*^{(n)},d_*^{(n)})$ threshold whenever for all $n \geq1$, each $e_n$ with $n$ odd (resp., even) $e_n$ is a  local maximum (resp., local minimum) relative  to $e_{n-1}$ with threshold $(h_*^{(n)},d_*^{(n)})$ of the truncated spectrum $\mu\Big\vert_{[e_{n-1},e_{+\infty}]}(E)$, that is,  in the range $e_{n-1}\leq E\leq e_{+\infty}$.
\end{Definition}


\begin{figure}[htb]
 \includegraphics[width=85mm]{figures/relative_local_max_min.eps}
 \caption{Sketch of XANES spectrum and breakpoints $e_1$, $e_3$ and $e_4$. Considering $e_3 - e_0 <d_* <e_4-e_1$, we have that $e_1$ and $e_3$  are local maxima with in a neighborhood of size $d_*$, while $e_3$  is not a local minimum in a neighborhood of same size due to the point $e_0$. Notice that the sharp decay of $\mu(E)$ in the range $e_1\leq E\leq e_3$ is controlled by the threshold $h_*$. Finally, note that if $e_5-e_1<d_*$ then the algorithm skip all the points in the range $e_1\leq E \leq e_4$ in the search for local minimum, being this one of the main reasons for readapting the threshold $d_*$ as the peak search happens; see also Figure \ref{fig:hidden_peak_trick} for more details. \label{fig:relative_local_max_min}}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[htb]
 \includegraphics[width=85mm]{figures/hidden_peak_trick.eps}
 \caption{Sketch of the \textit{hidden peak trick} in a XANES spectrum $\mu(E)$. Considering an iteration from the local minimum $e_2$ with thresholds $(h^{(2)},d^{(2)})$, after which the algorithm constructs a Rising sun function $\mathcal{R}_{\mu}$. When $\vert\mu(f_1) - \mu(e_2)\vert<h^{(2)}<\vert\mu(e_3) - \mu(e_2)\vert$,  the algorithm sets $e_3$ as the next breakpoint, i.e., as local maximum, while skipping all the points in the range $e_2\leq E\leq e_3$. This is problematic, for it could clearly miss local minima as  $f_2$. The algorithm was implemented to check this case, allowing for two options: (i) $e_2$ is set as $f_2$, or (ii) $e_3$ is set as $f_1$; the algorithm runs from $e_3$ after this reassignment.  \label{fig:hidden_peak_trick}}
\end{figure}
\noindent
It is clear that a local maximum $e_0$ relative to $e_{-\infty}$ with threshold $(h_*^{(n)},d_*^{(n)})$ consists of a 1-breakpoint with $(h_*^{(n)},d_*^{(n)})$ threshold. The previous definition %is exactly what we are looking for: it 
takes into account the order of the peaks and their sequential, pairwise, relative height. This step also implies that all the elements $e_n$ in \eqref{chain} with an  even index $n$ (resp., odd index $n$) are apart by a distance at least $d_*^{(n)}$. 

Several aspects of the previous definitions are worth of discussion. For simplicity, consider the thresholds  $(h_*^{(n)},d_*^{(n)})$ constants in $n$, assuming the value $(h_*,d_*)$:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textnormal{(\arabic*)}]%[label=(\roman*), ref=\thelemma(\roman*)]
\item[(C1)] \label{C1}  For any $n>1$, it is possible that the element $e_n$ in a M-breakpoint sequence with threshold $(h_*,d_*)$ is a local minimum/maximum  of $\mu\Big\vert_{[e_{n-1},e_{+\infty}]}(E)$, but not of $\mu\Big\vert_{[e_{-\infty},e_{+\infty}]}(E)$ (see Figure \ref{fig:relative_local_max_min}). However, it is true that the distance between any two successive local maxima or two distinct local minima in the chain $e_{-\infty}\leq e_0< e_1 <\ldots <e_M \leq e_{+\infty}$ is bigger than $d_*$. Therefore, they are all peaks with threshold  $(h_*,d_*)$ in $[e_0, e_{+\infty}]$. 

\item[(C2)] \label{C2} There is a trade-off between $h_*$ and $d_*$, and varying these quantities as the algorithm evolves is important to avoid local minima between two local maxima that would otherwise go undetected, as discussed in Figure \ref{fig:relative_local_max_min}. Three mechanisms are in place to avoid this problem: (a)  sharp variations in spectrum behavior are captured by the oscillation threshold (that is, $h_*$ large), (b) thresholds can vary throughout the search for breakpoints (see the  algorithm \ref{alg:_peak_location} and Figure \ref{fig:Statistics}), and the most effective of them all (c), called  the \textit{hidden peak tricks}, two techniques that introduce a spatial delay in the algorithm in order to verify whether its breakpoints are indeed local minimum/maximum, in some cases at risk of violating the peak threshold (see Figure \ref{fig:hidden_peak_trick}).
\item[(C3)] \label{C3}The number $M$ is an upper bound on the number of peaks to be sought. In fact, the algorithm can stop before that many points are found: this is verified by checking if end of the range of measurement has been reached. Indeed, checking the Definition \ref{def:rising_sun} close to the endpoint can be an issue which we overcome by embedding the spectra in a higher dimensional space in a trivial fashion, that is, gluing the rightmost point to a constant in a continuous fashion; the latter does not affect peak location, peak height, nor the oscillation function (see Definition \ref{def:osc}). 

\end{enumerate}


\noindent
The following auxiliary constructions are useful to verify the properties in the previous definitions.
\begin{Definition}[Rising Sun and Valley of Shadows]
Given the XANES measurement $\mu(E)$ in the energy range $e_{-\infty}\leq E\leq e_{+\infty}$,   we define the Rising Sun operator
%
\begin{align}\label{rising_sun}
  \mathcal{R}_{\mu}(E) = \max_{e_{-\infty}\leq x \leq E} \mu(x),% \quad e_{-\infty} \leq E\leq e_{+\infty},
\end{align}
%
where we call the function $\mathcal{R}_{\mu}(E)$ the Rising Sun function (associated to $\mu(E)$). We also define the Valley of Shadows operator,
%
\begin{align}\label{valley_of_shadows}
  \mathcal{V}_{\mu}(E) = \mathcal{R}_{\mu}(E) -  \mu(E),%\quad e_{-\infty} \leq E\leq e_{+\infty},
\end{align}
%
where we call the mapping $\mathcal{V}_{\mu}(E)$ the Valley of Shadows function (associated to $\mu(E)$).
\end{Definition}
The following properties are an immediate consequence of the definition \ref{def:rising_sun} and the construction of the Rising Sun and Valley of Shadow functions $\mathcal{R}_{\mu}(E), \mathcal{V}_{\mu}(E)$, respectively.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textnormal{(\arabic*)}]%[label=(\roman*), ref=\thelemma(\roman*)]
%\hangindent\leftmargin
 \item[(R1)] \label{R1} The function $\mathcal{R}_{\mu}(E)$ is non-decreasing. Furthermore, the inequality  $\mu(E) \leq \mathcal{R}_{\mu}(E)$ (equivalently,  $ 0 \leq \mathcal{V}_{S}[\mu](E)$) holds;

   \item[(R2)]\label{R2} Any non-decreasing function is invariant under the Rising Sun operator. In particular, the Rising Sun function is a fixed point of the Rising Sun operator, namely, $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{R}_{\mu}}(E) = \mathcal{R}_{\mu}(E)$;

   \item[(R3)]\label{R3} 
  Let the point $\overline{e}_1$ be the first local maximum of $\mu$ in the range $e_{-\infty}\leq E\leq e_{-\infty}$ with  threshold $(h_*,d_*)$. Then, $\overline{e}_1$ is the a local maximum of $\mathcal{R}_{\mu}$ in the range $e_{-\infty}\leq E\leq e_{-\infty}$ with  threshold $(h_*,d_*)$, that is, 
%
$$\mu(\overline{e}_1)=\mathcal{R}_{\mu}(\overline{e}_1) = \mathcal{R}_{\mu}(E), \quad  \overline{e}_1 \leq E < \overline{e}_1 + d_*.$$ In other words, the functions $\mu(E)$ and its associated Rising Sun function $\mathcal{R}_{\mu}$ have the same first maximum in the range $e_{-\infty}\leq E\leq e_{+\infty}$;

\item[(R4)]\label{R4}  Consider the first peak $\overline{e}_1$ with threshold $(h_*, d_*)$. Let $\overline{e}_2$ be the first local maximum with threshold $(h_*,d_*)$ of $\mathcal{V}_{\mu}(E)$ in the range $\overline{e}_1\leq E\leq e_{+\infty}$. Then
%
$(\overline{e}_2,\mu(\overline{e}_2))$ is a local minimum of $\mu\Big|_{[e_0,e_{+\infty}]}(E)$ with threshold $(h_*,d_*)$. Furthermore, 
$e_{-\infty}\leq e_0<e_1\leq e_{+\infty}$ is a sequence of  2-breakpoints with threshold $(h_*,d_*)$.
%
\end{enumerate}
%

\begin{figure}[htb]
 \includegraphics[width=85mm]{figures/XANES_and_rising_sunFe2O3}
 \caption{A spectral measurement $\mu(E)$ of $Fe_2O_3$ from \cite{Asakura},

\end{figure}
%
\noindent
We carefully explain each of these  properties, as they are used in the implementation of Algorithm \ref{alg:_peak_location}: properties in (\hyperref[R1]{R1}) show that the Rising Sun function $\mathcal{R}_{\mu}(E)$ is the smallest non-decreasing majorant of $\mu(E)$; (\hyperref[R3]{R2}) shows that the family of non-decreasing functions is closed under the action of the Rising Sun operator; (\hyperref[R4]{R3}) asserts the invariance of the location and strength of the first local maximum with threshold $(h_*,d_*)$;  (\hyperref[R4]{R4}) provides the main idea of the algorithms, giving the foundation for the recursion in the sequence of smaller intervals $[e_{n-1},e_{+\infty}]\supset[e_{n},e_{+\infty}]$.
%
\paragraph*{Quantification of thresholds $(h_*,d_*)$.}\label{subsec:quantification} In the algorithm, the thresholds $(h_*^{(0)}, d_*^{(0)})$ are initialized before the peak search begins. Both quantities are highly dependent on the nature of the spectroscopy problem one deals with (see also Section \ref{subsec:eels_raman}): %:we are dealing with:  
easier to quantify, $h_*$ denotes a the threshold for peak height aiming to distinguish peaks from random noise fluctuations; it is mostly dependent on the statistical error quantification or, more precisely, on the effect of noise on the regularity of $\mu(E)$. We estimate it using an oscillation function:

\begin{Definition}[Oscillation function]\label{def:osc}
 We define the oscillation threshold $h_*^{\mu}$ of   $\mu(E)$ as 
 %
 \begin{align*}
h_*= \omega_*^{\mu}(\delta), \quad \text{for} \quad \omega_*^{\mu}(j \delta) = \max_{\vert E - E'\vert\leq j \delta } \vert \mu(E) - \mu(E')\vert.
 \end{align*}
 where $\omega_*^{\mu}(E)$ is called  \textit{oscillation function} of $\mu(E)$.
\end{Definition}
%
It is straightforward to show that $\omega_*^{\mathcal{R}_{\mu}}(j\delta)\leq \omega_*^{\mu}(j\delta)$, which amounts to saying that $\mathcal{R}_{\mu}(E)$ is more regular (less noisy) than the function $\mu(E)$ it is associated to; this can be seen as a \textit{denoising} effect, even though the analysis is not carried out in frequency space. 

In contrast to the previous case, the parameter  $d_*$ is heavily dependent on the distribution of peaks throughout the spectrum, which a priori is unknown. \hl{Notice that, by the construction of the Rising Sun function and} (\hyperref[C1]{C1}), \hl{we conclude that estimates on the distance between peaks provide estimates on the size of plateaus.} To initialize the code an estimate of this  distance is given by $d_*^{(0)}$ as%, which we define as follows:
%
\begin{align}\label{estimate_d_0}
d_*^{(0)} = x_{1} - x_{0}, 
\end{align}
%
where we first compute $x_1$ as local maximum with threshold $(\lambda_1 h_*,\lambda_2 d_*)$ relative to $(e_{-\infty},\mu(e_{-\infty}))$; the quantities $\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}$ are positive hyperparameters, which in computations for XANES were set as $\lambda_1=4$ and $\lambda_2=\frac{1}{4}$. It is clear from it's construction that we have $e_0 = x_1$.
%
Subsequently, we define $x_{0}$ as
%
\begin{align}
x_{0} = \max \left\{e_{-\infty}\leq E\leq e_{1} \,\Big|  \mu(E)  \leq \mu(-\infty) +h^{(0)}_* \right\}.
\end{align}
%
Setting $\mathrm{\alpha}_{\text{decay}}^{(n)}=\frac{\max_{\tilde{x},\tilde{y} \in[e_{n},e_{+\infty}]}{\vert \mu(\tilde{x}) - \mu(\tilde{y}) \vert}}{\max_{x,y \in[e_{-\infty},e_{+\infty}]}{\vert \mu(x) - \mu(y) \vert}}$, we define 
\begin{align*}
%
h_*^{(n+1)} &= \mathrm{\alpha}_{\text{decay}}^{(n)}\cdot h_*^{(n)},\\
\quad d_*^{(n+1)} &= \mathrm{\alpha}_{\text{decay}}^{(n)}\cdot \max\left\{\text{average}\left(d_*^{(k)}\right)_{0\leq k \leq n},2\right\}.
\end{align*}
%
%
\noindent
In the numerical code, this estimate is called \textit{min max method}; clearly, variations are possible and give different results, specially for peaks that are harder to distinguish from pure noise spikes. A clear objection to this method is that it uses the decay information about peaks to infer the decay for peak separation, which although give good results for small number of peaks, can be   far-fetched. For that reason other methods were also designed. The threshold formula is 
 \begin{align}\label{exponential_regression}
  d_*^{(n)} = \max\left\{\left(\lambda_3 e^{-n} + \frac{n}{2} \right)\frac{2L}{n+1}, 2\right\},
 \end{align}
%
 where $\lambda_3$ is a hyperparameter. Each method estimates the quantity $L$ in a different way:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item[i.] (\textit{Regression}) Given the location of i peaks, estimate the plateau size of the next one by doing the a regression of type 
 %
 \begin{align*}
  L = \alpha_d \exp\left\{\beta_d (i+1)\right\},
 \end{align*}
where $\alpha_d$ and $\beta_d$ are estimated using  $\{d_*^{(j)}\}_{0\leq j \leq i}$. 

\item[ii.] (\textit{Learn to trust}) Given the location of i peaks, estimate the the quantity L as 
$$L = \text{average}\left(d_*^{(k)}\right)_{0\leq k \leq n}.$$
\end{enumerate}
%
%
Assuming $L$ fixed, note that when $n=0$ the estimate \eqref{exponential_regression} gives 
%
$$d_*^{(0)} = \max\left\{\lambda_3L,2 \right\};$$
%
on the other hand, as $n\to +\infty$
$$\lim_{n \to +\infty}d_*^{(n)} =  \max\left\{L,2 \right\}.$$
%
The idea is that the initial guess  given by the hyperparameter $\lambda_3$ plays an important role in the search of peaks immediately after the first located peak, but this guess lose importance as the method gather more data from previous peaks,  eventually \textit{learning form it}.  In Fig. \ref{fig:Statistics} we plot a comparison between several methods to estimate the distance; ; see \cite{github} for further details.

\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Searching on the other side of the Near-Edge peak: the reflection method.}\label{subsec:reflection}

By construction,  the algorithm starts at  $e_0$,  somehow ignoring any peak to the left of it. This is somewhat intentional, and is done for two reasons: first, away from the peak-edge (the ``0th peak"), peaks on both sides decay at different rates; second, the algorithm can use itself in a recursive fashion to search for peaks on the left side once it has finished the search on the right side. The latter is carried out by reflection of the spectrum  about the peak-edge,   $\widetilde{\mu}(E) \equiv \mu( e_{-\infty}+e_{+\infty} -E)$; the initial thresholds $\widetilde{h}_*^{(0)}$ and  $\widetilde{d}_*^{(0)}$ are estimated from $h_*^{(n)}$ and  $d_*^{(n)}$. 
%
The output is shown in Figure \ref{fig:other_side_with_marked_peaks}.

For peaks on the right (resp. left) of the 0th peak, i.e., peak $e_i$ with  $i>0$ (resp. $i<0$), the  color of the marker indicates the ratio between oscillation in $\mu\Big|_{[e_{i},e_{+\infty}]}$ (resp. $\mu\Big|_{[e_{-\infty}, e_{i}]}$ and the amount of jump to the previous peak. The color on the 0th peak is the ration between oscillation in the whole energy range $[e_{-\infty}, e_{+\infty}]$ and its jump (or estimated jump) to previous peak. \label{fig:other_side_with_marked_peaks}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Pathological measurements, threshold readjustment,  and the role of noise.}\label{subsec:pathological}

\hl{We remark that the algorithm makes use of noise at its benefits: indeed, the algorithm would stop in the first peak of a polygonal curve that has plateaus bigger than $d_*$; the implementation takes these as pathological cases, for they are not expected in XANES.} Moreover, in the case of an unsuccessful search for peaks with thresholds $(h_*,d_*)$, the algorithm readjust the quantities to 
%
$$ h_*\leftarrow  \lambda_4 h_*, \quad \text{and} \quad d_* \leftarrow d_* -1,$$
%
either in an alternate fashion or simultaneously ($\lambda_4$ is a hyperparameter, that was set as $\lambda_4 = 0.9$ throughout our computations); see \cite{github} for further details.


\section*{Further applications}

\paragraph{A dimension reduction method using judiciously chosen  breakpoints for interpolation.}\label{subsec:dimension_reduc}

 With the breakpoints $e_{-\infty}\leq e_{-M_{-\infty}}\leq \cdots\leq  e_0 \leq e_1 \leq \cdots \leq e_{M_{\infty}}\leq e_{+\infty}$ in hands we now look for a lower dimensional representation of $\mu(E)$ in the energy range $e_{-\infty}\leq E \leq e_{-\infty}$. That is, given the points  $\displaystyle{\left(e_{m}, \mu(e_{m})\right)_{-M_{-\infty}\leq m \leq M_{\infty}}}$ we can choose several methods to interpolate the given spectrum $\mu(E)$ (see Figure \ref{fig:clamped_FeO}). The number of points in the interpolation can be increased by further  refinement of the intervals $\left[e_m,e_{m+1}\right]$, for $m \in \{-M_{-\infty},\ldots ,M_{\infty}-1\}$. 
%
\begin{figure}[htb]
 \includegraphics[width=85mm]{figures/clamped_splines_ofFeOwith24points}
 \caption{Glued Clamped Cubic Spline for $FeO$, with 24 interpolation points, using judiciously chosen interpolating points chosen by the  Rising Sun Envelope Method. \label{fig:clamped_FeO}}
\end{figure}
%
The breakpoints $e_{m}$, for $-M_{-\infty}\leq m \leq M_{\infty}$ provide a partition of the energy range $e_{-\infty}\leq E\leq e_{+\infty}$ into intervals of \textit{almost monotonic behavior}. In passing, it allows for the use of interpolation methods that exploit this fact. Indeed, in between two successive breakpoints we interpolated a cubic clamped spline, that is, a spline in  with zero derivative at its endpoints; we call it glued clamped cubic spline (GCCS) the resulting concatenation of the these clamped cubic splines along the interpolated intervals, a result that  provides a better quality of approximation when compared to other types of interpolations (see Figure \ref{fig:error}). Other techniques have also been implemented; for instance: padding the endpoints of the XANES spectrum with constants was used to tame the wild behavior of interpolation near the boundaries \cite[\S 5.2.1]{HaTiFr}, where the spectrum was padded, interpolated and then truncated to the relevant energy region. 
%

In Figure \ref{fig:error} the $l^{\infty}$  error (i,.e., maximum of absolute difference) is displayed: there, a comparison between the clamped splines approximation is compared to other interpolations that either contain the found peaks as interpolants, or to a case in which the interpolation is simply performed in an equally spaced meshgrid. Our result show good quality in low number (dimension) of interpolating points.

 \caption{The judicious choice of interpolation points provided by our algorithm leads to better approximation result in $l^{\infty}$ norm, and also to exact location of peaks. \label{fig:error}}
\end{figure}




\paragraph{Inflection point calculation.}\label{subsec:inflect point}
In figure \ref{fig:First_derivative} the first derivative of the interpolant approximation. For peak location purposes, plotting the first derivative is unnecessary because the Rising Sun Envelope Method, for given thresholds, finds exact peak location. Nevertheless, it is common in the literature to associate the highest value of the first derivative to the point of highest absorption, which is also called  the  \textit{Absorption Edge}.  As an  inflection point of the XANES measurement, the second derivative of the measurement is commonly  computed in spite of its poor quality due to noise (see Figure \ref{fig:First_derivative}). For comparison, we plot the first derivative of our interpolant and all its inflection points, which are robust and more amenable to computation due to the good differentiability properties of the clamped splines in each interval they are defined in. The poor information given by the second derivative of the spectrum prevents much information to be obtained from it whereas,  in contrast, the quality of the inflection points found using the clamped splines approximation. We highlight that the approximation used in Figure \ref{fig:First_derivative} requires only 28 interpolation points out of $418$, that is, only approximately  $6\%$  of the whole  spectrum information was used.

\end{figure}


\paragraph{Applications to EELS and Raman spectra.}\label{subsec:eels_raman}

The characterization of peaks shift and its intensity in EELS have a similar reason as that in XANES, therefore it is a natural object for validation of our code (see Figure \ref{fig:EELS}).
In Fig. \ref{fig:Raman} we show the outcome of our method to Raman Spectra of Sulfur.  In this kind of Spectroscopy, it is more common to use Peak location as a first step, which is succeeded by  Gaussian fitting  \cite{byler1988raman}, a case that is out of the scope of the Rising Sun Envelope Method.  Notice that in Raman the distribution of peaks is more erratic, and peak strengths do not visibly seem to decay around a particular peak. Nevertheless, the Rising Sun Envelope Method can still be applied in this case.

\section*{Discussion and Conclusions}
\noindent

The Rising Sun Envelope Method is accurate in locating peak intensity and peak location, allowing for discernment between \textit{true peaks} from \textit{random noise spikes}. \hl{The method} takes into account the intrinsic noise of the measurement, which makes it suitable for noisy functions, in particular for experimental measurements. It  provides an automated approach to peak decomposition that uses the pointwise structure of the function and its intrinsic properties.

Our results also provide a more accurate way to locate the peak-edge region (see Figure \ref{fig:First_derivative}); overall, it is the first case in which this computation can be fully performed automatically.

The choice for peaks as interpolating points in polygonal or cubic spline approximations is shown to be an effective way to reduce the dimension of the spectral measurements. This choice is faithful to  two qualities that are crucial in material oxidation analysis:  peak location and its strength (see Figure \ref{fig:other_side_with_marked_peaks}). In effect, there are many reasons to pursue this kind of reductions: the first can be found in the  initial steps of the ML model in \cite{miyazato2019automatic}, where  a measure of the peak shift was the way the authors  found to  overcome this high dimensionality issue, considerably reducing the dimension of each XANES measurement in a way that is physically consistent with experiments; the Rising Sun Envelope method was originally developed with the intent of engineering more accurate horizontal peak shift features. Another reason to pursue dimensional reduction is due to   the difference between the dimension of spectral measurements (of order $\mathcal{O}(1000)$) and the
%\reversemarginpar
sample size (of order $\mathcal{O}(100)$), yielding  disparity  between number of variables and number of constraints  that prevents good fitting and the use of nonlocal Machine Learning methods (as Convolution Neural Networks) \cite[\S 9]{goodfellow2016deep}.
Still, a third reason can be presented: the availability of more data of XANES measurements by initiatives like  \cite{mathew2018high} will make the use ML and other Artificial Intelligence methods more common, accurate, and effective in the field of Material Sciences \cite{butler2018machine,takahashi2016materials}; the clamped spline interpolations we found not only reduce the dimension of the data, but further capture the complexity of the XANES measurement in a regularized fashion that is accurate and representative.\newline
