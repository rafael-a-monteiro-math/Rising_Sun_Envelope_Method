# RisingSun Method-XANES_dimension-reduction

This is a repository with code for the paper <h>XANES and the Rising sun Method ....</h>, based on a very onl lemma of Riesz https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_sun_lemma.

The idea consists of "regularizing" the XANES measurement by creating several Rising-sun functions in domains that are nested and smaller, leading to the convergence of the algorithm.

# Comments:

There are many steps in the code that can be optimized: there are many brute-force searches that were carried out in a "careless", non-optimal way, and for someone who might use this code in a daily basis this will make the difference between a code that runs in minutes rather than hours. Please, write, improve, and make our code better. We are advocating for a new business here, and we think that there is still a lot to be improved. 

## Parts where we think the code can be improved:

1. Definitely, the plateau search can be improved: it doesn't need to return only one location, but it can return all the plateau locations
2. The interpolation can be improved
